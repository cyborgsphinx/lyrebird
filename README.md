Lyrebird
========

This was a project we had to do in my operating systems class.
The original was written in C, as this was an undergrad class.
I enjoyed what I did, so I decided to see if I could make the same thing happen in Rust.
There are three parts, but I'm just going to build up to the end incrementally instead of seperating them out.
The final part was the most interesting anyway.
